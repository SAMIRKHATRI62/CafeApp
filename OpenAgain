To get a new public URL next time (free Quick Tunnel), you only need these steps:

Start your app locally
In PowerShell:
cd c:\Users\Acer\Desktop\COPILOT\CafeApp
npm start
Keep this terminal open.
Start the Cloudflare tunnel (this generates the URL)
Open a second PowerShell window and run:
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
Copy the https://....trycloudflare.com link it prints
That’s your new URL. Share that link.
Notes:

If you stop npm start or close the tunnel window, the URL stops working.
The URL changes every time you run the tunnel again (that’s normal for the free “no domain” method).
